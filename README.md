# 7-Segment Display Circuit using 7447IC

## Introduction

The 7-Segment Display Circuit is a simple electronics project that demonstrates the use of a 7447IC (Integrated Circuit) to convert Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) numbers into a format that can be displayed on a 7-segment LED display. This project is educational and can serve as a foundation for understanding digital electronics and display technologies.

## Components Required

To build this project, you will need the following components:

1. **7447IC**: This is a BCD to 7-segment latch/decoder/driver IC.
2. **7-Segment Display (Common Anode or Common Cathode)**: Choose the type that matches your 7447IC.
3. **4-Way Dip Switch**: Used to input BCD numbers.
4. **Resistors**:
   - 10k-ohm resistor (for current limiting).
   - 470-ohm resistor (for current limiting of 7-segment display segments).
5. **Breadboard**: To create the circuit on.
6. **Jumper Wires**: For connecting components.

## How the Project Works

1. The 4-way Dip Switch is used to input a 4-bit Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) number.
2. The 7447IC takes the BCD input and converts it into the appropriate signals for lighting up the segments of the 7-segment display.
3. The 7-segment display then shows the corresponding decimal number.

## Usage

1. Assemble the circuit on the breadboard as per the provided circuit diagram.
2. Ensure all connections are secure.
3. Power up the circuit (usually with +5V) and ground (0V).
4. Use the Dip Switch to set the BCD input.
5. Observe the 7-segment display to see the converted decimal number.
