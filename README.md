# 7-Segment-Display-Circuit
&amp;-Segment Display circuit Display formation using 7447IC.
This Project converts BCD numbers to 7 Segmenet display using 7447IC.
Components reuired are :
1.. 7447IC
2.. 7 segment display LED
3.. 4-way Dip Switch
4.. resistors (10k-ohms, 470 ohms)
5.. Bread board
6.. Jumper wires

here full detailed report is added here where you will get clear circuit diagram and how our project is working.
